## Purpose

This document explains how AI tools were used during the development of the streaming dashboard assignment. The goal is transparency and clarity about where AI contributed and where it did not.

## How AI Was Used

AI assistance was limited to guidance and clarification. No AI-generated code was copied directly into the project. The actual implementation, structure, logic, debugging, and deployment were completed manually.

**1. Understanding the assignment**

AI was used to break the task into clear steps and confirm the expected workflow:

=> Next.js App Router setup

=> API integration requirements

=> Components needed for the UI

=> Deployment steps for Vercel

This helped verify the plan before starting the build.

**2. Technical clarifications**

AI was used for short, specific explanations:

=> Typical TMDB endpoints and response fields

=> How to configure environment variables in Next.js

=> Reminders for TypeScript interfaces and component boundaries

=> When to use server vs client components

These were used as references, not templates.

**3. Troubleshooting and error explanations**

AI helped interpret a few issues during development, such as:

=> Server-side fetch behavior

=> Image domain configuration

=> Common Next.js 14 App Router mistakes

All fixes were implemented manually based on the explanations.

## What Was Not Done by AI

=> No UI components were generated by AI

=> No layout, styling, or Tailwind classes were produced by AI

=> No fetch utilities, page files, or dynamic routes were written by AI

=> No code was copied from any AI response

=> The final codebase, folder structure, logic flow, and deployment setup were all created personally

## Summary

AI acted as a reference tool for planning and clarification.
The design, coding, debugging, optimization, and deployment were done independently.
