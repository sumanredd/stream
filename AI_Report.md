## AI Tools Used

ChatGPT was used for guidance, clarifying errors, understanding TMDB endpoints, and getting small code examples.


## Parts of the Project That Used AI Assistance Heavily

AI assistance was mainly used for support, not full code generation. These areas used AI guidance more than others:

**Tailwind styling ideas**
Used AI to confirm responsive classes, layout patterns, and quick styling patterns.

**Configuration setup**
Asked AI how to configure:

=> next.config.js image domains

=> Tailwind setup steps

=> Environment variable usage with Next.js App Router

**Search component logic**
Used AI to help reason about issues with refs, click handlers, and dropdown behavior.

**Utility functions and fetch patterns**
Used AI for examples of server-side fetch helpers and safe error handling patterns.

All files were written manually and adjusted to match the project needs. No AI-generated code was pasted directly without modification.

## Summary

AI was used as a support tool for planning, debugging, and getting specific code hints.
All core logic, UI components, routing, data fetching, styling, and deployment work were implemented manually.
